## Featuring  

* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as Editor
* [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) as terminal emulator
* [MesloGS NF](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#meslo) as a font, patched with [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
* [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) as a shell
* [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) for top bar
* [hyprland](https://hypr.land/) as a window manager

## Other Tools
Most of these dont have dotfiles associated with them, but i use them nonetheless. 

* [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - cmake but for shell scripts
* [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) - a modern ls
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - for containerizing projects
* [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - with [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) as a theme
