# My *awesome* dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles for the different programs and tools I use on a day to day.

## Featuring  

* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as Editor

* [Slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides) for the CLI. Check out [charm](https://charm.sh/) while your at it.

### Bonus

If your mad enough to put linux on an Asus Zenbook Duo, you can find the XORG conf files required to get the second screen working +
calibration [here](misc).
