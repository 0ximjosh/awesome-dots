# My *awesome* dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles for the different programs and tools I use on a day to day.

### Featuring  

* `Neovim` as Editor
* `Kitty` as terminal emulator
* `Tmux` as a multiplexer
* `AwesomeWM` as window manager
* `picom` as compositor
* `rofi` as application launcher

And a little extra;  
If your mad enough to put linux on an Asus Zenbook Duo, you can find the XORG conf files required to get the second screen working +
calibration.
