# The `Awesome` Dotfiles.

A very minimal set of dotfiles for awesome.
Enough to get the job done without sacrificing speed.

## Features

* Lightweight volume popup that I spent far too much time on
* Toggles for `stay ontop` and converting tiled clients to floating
* Random wallpapers from nordic github repo
* Rofi menu's for starting applications & power menu
* Screenshotter that copies to clipboard
* Blur effects (thanks picom)
* Made with multihead setupts as a focus
* Blazingly Fast

## Dependencies

* awesome-git
    * Is not compatable with `awesome`, need the git version
* Picom
    * Picom adds blur effect to most windows.
* maim
    * Screenshotter
* xclip
    * Copy screenshots
* wallpaper directory
    * Wallpapers
    * Can be any directory containing only images

Make sure to check `rc.lua` for `terminal`, `editor`, and `editor_cmd` and set them as such.

## Structure

All key binds are in `keys.lua`  
Helper functions are in `helpers.lua`  
Shell scripts are in `scripts`  
Volume Slider is, well I think you can find it.  

These will be most likely be further broken out as I work on the files  
The goal is for these to be extremely portable, and stay as fast as possible.

# To-dos

- [X] Move all key files to keys folder
- [X] Possibly add more Keybinds
- [ ] Create init script
- [ ] Move startup programs to separate file
- [X] Make wallpaper script more configurable
- [ ] Make central location for variables
